            <div class="intro">Sous vide chicken is a great way to meal prep your protein for the week or two. Whether you pan-fry them with some oil or chop them cold for a salad, there are many ways to use chicken breast made this way.
             Sous vide helps retain a lot of the juicy tenderness while also being a lot more forgiving if overcooked. </div>

        <div class="border"><h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4-5 lb boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>4-5 tsp salt</li>
                <li>4-5 tsp black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol><div>
                <li>Set sous vide to 150 F.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add your chicken breast, salt and pepper, and any other seasoning you may want to include. Mix throughly to cover all parts of the meat.</li>
                <li>Place individual breast into vacuum bags and vacuum seal shut, or alternatively, you can use ziploc bags pulling as much air as you can out.</li>
                <li>Place bags into water bath for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes to ensure that they are cooked through.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, you can take them out of the bag, pat dry, and pan fry each side, for a couple of minutes each side, for a nice golden crust or cool them down via an ice bath to store in the refrigerater/freezer for a later date.</li>
