        <p><div>Greek yogurt is a great source of protein and I just can't get enough! Bake it, dip it, drink it, or just eat it. There are many versatile ways to use this in all your cooking.
             Making your own is a great way to get the right texture you want as well as remove a lot of the whey for a nice keto dessert.
              Using a sous vide machine helps a lot to prevent any burning in the initial step and an easy way to keep a consistent temp for the incubation process.</div></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon Milk</li>
                <li>yogurt starter or 1 cup(8oz) full fat plain yogurt</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol><div>
                <li>Set sous vide to 180 F.</li>
                <li>Heat your gallon of milk for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Take out from sous vide and let it cool to to under 110 F. Use a thermometer to confirm temperature to prevent killing bacteria from the starter/yogurt.</li>
                <li>Combine starter/yogurt with the cooled milk.</li>
                <li>Set sous vide to 109 F.</li>
                <li>Pour milk into glass jars and incubate in the sous vide for 12 hours, or for a more thick yogurt, up to 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Once done, empty into nylon mesh strainer to remove as much whey as you like to create a nice thick greek yogurt.</li>
            </div></ol>
